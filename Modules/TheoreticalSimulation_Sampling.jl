# Particle sampling for the SG beamline simulation
#
# This file implements two layers:
#
#   1. Slit-acceptance sampling (rejection sampling)
#      _generate_samples_serial / _generate_samples_multithreaded / generate_samples
#      Draw initial (position, velocity) states from the furnace aperture and
#      the chosen velocity PDF, propagate them ballistically to the entrance
#      slit, and keep only those whose straight-line trajectory passes through
#      the slit aperture. This is standard geometric rejection sampling for an
#      effusive atomic beam source.
#
#   2. CQD branch assignment
#      generate_CQDinitial_conditions
#      For each accepted particle, draws a pair of Co-Quantum-Dynamics angles
#      (θe, θn) and classifies the particle into an "up" or "down" branch
#      depending on which angle is larger, splitting the population into the
#      two batches used downstream by the CQD trajectory integrator.

# Generate samples post-filtering by the slit
"""
    _generate_samples_serial(No::Int, rng::AbstractRNG, p::EffusionParams;
                             v_pdf::Symbol = :v3,
                             max_trial_multiplier::Int = 10_000) -> Matrix{Float64}
 
Generate `No` accepted (“alive”) particles that pass the entrance slit by
rejection sampling initial positions and velocities, then checking the ray
intersection at the slit plane.
 
Each accepted row is `[x0, y0, z0, v0x, v0y, v0z]` with `y0 = 0.0` (SI units).
 
# Arguments
- `No::Int`: Number of accepted particles to return (must be > 0 and equal to `size(alive, 1)` conceptually).
- `rng::AbstractRNG`: Random-number generator used for all sampling.
- `p::EffusionParams`: Parameters forwarded to the velocity samplers.
 
# Keywords
- `v_pdf::Symbol = :v3`: Velocity PDF selector, resolved **once** before the
  sampling loop starts (not re-checked on every trial):
  - `:v3` → `AtomicBeamVelocity_v3(rng, p)`
  - `:v2` → `AtomicBeamVelocity_v2(rng, p)`
  - Any other value throws an `ArgumentError` immediately.
- `max_trial_multiplier::Int = 10_000`: Safety cap on total proposal trials,
  expressed as a multiple of `No`. If `iteration_count` exceeds
  `No * max_trial_multiplier` before `No` particles have been accepted, the
  function throws an error rather than looping indefinitely — this guards
  against a misconfigured geometry/PDF combination silently hanging.
 
# Algorithm
1. Sample transverse position uniformly over the furnace rectangle:
   - `x0 ∈ [-DEFAULT_x_furnace/2, +DEFAULT_x_furnace/2]`
   - `z0 ∈ [-DEFAULT_z_furnace/2, +DEFAULT_z_furnace/2]`
2. Sample velocity `v = (v0x, v0y, v0z)` using the chosen PDF.
3. Reject if `|v0y| ≤ 1e-18` to avoid singular drift.
4. Propagate to the slit at `y = DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit` (straight-line drift):
   - `x_at_slit = x0 + DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit * v0x / v0y`
   - `z_at_slit = z0 + DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit * v0z / v0y`
5. Accept if the ray intersects the rectangular aperture:
   - `|x_at_slit| ≤ DEFAULT_x_slit/2` and `|z_at_slit| ≤ DEFAULT_z_slit/2`
6. Repeat until `No` rows are accepted; store as `Float64`.
 
# Returns
- `Matrix{Float64}` of size `No × 6`, columns:
  1. `x0`, 2. `y0 (= 0.0)`, 3. `z0`, 4. `v0x`, 5. `v0y`, 6. `v0z`.
 
# Globals expected in scope
- `DEFAULT_x_furnace`, `DEFAULT_z_furnace`,
- `DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit`,
- `DEFAULT_x_slit`, `DEFAULT_z_slit`.
 
# Notes
- Displays a live `ProgressMeter` progress bar tracking accepted particles
  (not total trials, which is unbounded), and prints total iteration count,
  acceptance rate, and timing (via `@time`) on completion.
- Rejection efficiency depends on geometry and the chosen velocity PDF.
 
# Throws
- `ArgumentError` if `v_pdf` is not `:v3` or `:v2`.
- `ErrorException` if `No` particles are not accepted within
  `No * max_trial_multiplier` trials (likely indicates near-zero acceptance
  probability from a geometry/PDF misconfiguration).

Generate `No` accepted (“alive”) particles **in parallel** by rejection sampling
initial positions and velocities and checking intersection with the entrance slit.
 
Each accepted row is `[x0, y0, z0, v0x, v0y, v0z]` with `y0 = 0.0` (SI units).
 
# Arguments
- `No::Int`: Number of particles to return (must be > 0).
- `base_seed::Int`: Base seed for per-thread RNGs. Reproducibility depends on
  thread count and seed (see *Parallelism & reproducibility*).
- `p::EffusionParams`: Parameters forwarded to the velocity sampler(s).
 
# Keywords
- `v_pdf::Symbol = :v3`: Velocity PDF selector, resolved **once** before any
  thread starts sampling (not re-checked on every trial):
  - `:v3` → `AtomicBeamVelocity_v3(rng, p)`
  - `:v2` → `AtomicBeamVelocity_v2(rng, p)`
  - Any other value throws an `ArgumentError` immediately.
- `max_trial_multiplier::Int = 10_000`: Safety cap on total proposal trials
  (summed across all threads), expressed as a multiple of `No`. If the shared
  `iteration_count` exceeds `No * max_trial_multiplier` before `No` particles
  have been accepted, the function throws an error rather than looping
  indefinitely — same safeguard as in [`_generate_samples_serial`](@ref).
 
# Returns
- `Matrix{Float64}` of size `No × 6`, columns:
  1. `x0`, 2. `y0 (= 0.0)`, 3. `z0`, 4. `v0x`, 5. `v0y`, 6. `v0z`.
 
# Algorithm
- Spawns a `Threads.@threads` loop where each thread:
  1. Initializes a `TaskLocalRNG()` seeded with `hash((base_seed, thread_id))`.
  2. Samples `x0, z0` uniformly in the furnace rectangle:
     - `x0 ∈ [-DEFAULT_x_furnace/2, +DEFAULT_x_furnace/2]`
     - `z0 ∈ [-DEFAULT_z_furnace/2, +DEFAULT_z_furnace/2]`
  3. Samples velocity `v = (v0x, v0y, v0z)` from the (pre-resolved) chosen PDF.
  4. Rejects near-zero `v0y` (|v0y| ≤ 1e-18) to avoid singular drift.
  5. Propagates to the slit at `y = DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit`:
     - `x_at_slit = x0 + DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit * v0x / v0y`
     - `z_at_slit = z0 + DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit * v0z / v0y`
  6. Accepts if `|x_at_slit| ≤ DEFAULT_x_slit/2` **and** `|z_at_slit| ≤ DEFAULT_z_slit/2`.
  7. On accept, obtains a unique 1-based write index
     `idx = Threads.atomic_add!(sample_count, 1) + 1` — the `+1` is required
     because `atomic_add!` returns the value of the counter *before* the
     addition, not after; if `idx ≤ No`, writes the row, otherwise breaks out.
 
Additionally tracks `iteration_count` (total trials) via an atomic counter.
The function prints timing for the threaded region, total iterations, and
the overall acceptance rate.
 
# Parallelism & reproducibility
- Each thread owns its RNG (`TaskLocalRNG()`), seeded from `base_seed` and `thread_id`.
- The **set of returned samples** is reproducible given the same `base_seed`
  **and the same `Threads.nthreads()`**. Row order is inherently non-deterministic
  due to concurrent acceptance and atomic indexing.
- If you require fully reproducible row order, sort after generation or use the
  serial sampler.
 
# Globals expected in scope
- Geometry: `DEFAULT_x_furnace`, `DEFAULT_z_furnace`,
  `DEFAULT_y_FurnaceToSlit`, `DEFAULT_x_slit`, `DEFAULT_z_slit`.
- Velocity samplers: `AtomicBeamVelocity_v3`, `AtomicBeamVelocity_v2`.
 
# Notes
- Uses rectangular aperture half-widths `hx = DEFAULT_x_slit/2`, `hz = DEFAULT_z_slit/2`.
- Displays a live `ProgressMeter` progress bar tracking accepted particles,
  updated under a lock since `next!` is not inherently safe to call
  concurrently from multiple threads. Contention is low since acceptance
  events are sparse relative to total trials.
- Prints timing due to `@time`, total trial count, and acceptance rate at the end.
- You can swap `TaskLocalRNG()` for a different per-thread RNG if desired
  (e.g., `MersenneTwister(hash((base_seed, thread_id)))`).
 
# Throws
- `ArgumentError` if `v_pdf` is not `:v3` or `:v2`.
- `ErrorException` if `No` particles are not accepted within
  `No * max_trial_multiplier` total trials across all threads.

High-level entry point to generate `No` accepted (“alive”) particle states that pass
the entrance slit. Dispatches to a serial or multithreaded sampler.
 
Each returned row is `[x0, y0, z0, v0x, v0y, v0z]` with `y0 = 0.0` (SI units).
 
# Arguments
- `No::Int`: Number of accepted particles to return (must be > 0).

# Keywords
- `v_pdf::Symbol = :v3`: Velocity PDF selector (`:v3` → `AtomicBeamVelocity_v3`,
  `:v2` → `AtomicBeamVelocity_v2`; other values throw `ArgumentError`).
- `rng = Random.DEFAULT_rng()`: RNG used **only in serial mode**.
- `multithreaded::Bool = false`: If `true`, uses the threaded sampler; otherwise serial.
- `base_seed::Int = 1234`: Per-thread seeding base used **only in multithreaded mode**.
- `max_trial_multiplier::Int = 10_000`: Forwarded to whichever sampler is
  used; aborts with an error if `No` particles aren't accepted within
  `No * max_trial_multiplier` total trials.
 
# Behavior
- `multithreaded = false` → calls `_generate_samples_serial(No, rng, p; v_pdf)`.
- `multithreaded = true`  → calls `_generate_samples_multithreaded(No, base_seed, p; v_pdf)`.
 
# Returns
- `Matrix{Float64}` of size `No × 6` with accepted initial conditions.
 
# Reproducibility
- Serial mode reproducibility is controlled by `rng`.
- Multithreaded mode uses per-thread RNGs seeded from `base_seed`; the **set** of
  samples is reproducible given the same `base_seed` and `Threads.nthreads()`,
  but row order may vary due to concurrency.

    generate_CQDinitial_conditions(No, alive, rng; mode=:partition)
        -> (up_batch::Matrix{T}, down_batch::Matrix{T})

Generate two sets of initial conditions by drawing per-particle angles and
classifying each draw as “up” (`θe < θn`) or “down” (`θe > θn`).

Each output matrix has 8 columns:
1–6: copied from `alive[:, 1:6]` (e.g. `x0,y0,z0,v0x,v0y,v0z`),  
7–8: the drawn angles `(θe, θn)`, where `θ = 2asin(sqrt(u))` with `u ~ U(0,1)`.

# Arguments
- `No::Integer`: number of particles (must equal `size(alive,1)`).
- `alive::AbstractMatrix{T}`: at least 6 columns with the base kinematic state;
  element type `T<:Real` is preserved in the outputs.
- `rng::AbstractRNG`: random-number generator used for the draws.
- `mode::Symbol = :partition`:
  - `:partition` → **two-pass exact split.**
    - Clones the RNG (`copy(rng)`) to count how many “up” samples will occur,
      allocates exact sizes (`n_up×8` and `n_down×8`), then fills using the
      original RNG so counts match.
  - `:balanced` → **single-pass balanced batches.**
    - Generates until both “up” and “down” reach size `No`, returning two
      `No×8` matrices (both reuse `alive[:,1:6]`).

# Returns
A tuple `(up_batch, down_batch)` of `Matrix{T}`.  
For `:partition`, sizes are `n_up×8` and `n_down×8` with `n_up + n_down = No`.  
For `:balanced`, both are `No×8`.

# Notes
- Preconditions: `No > 0`, `size(alive,1) == No`, and `size(alive,2) ≥ 6`.
- `:partition` requires `copy(rng)` to exist so the counting pass doesn’t
  advance the RNG used for filling. If your RNG can’t be copied, consider a
  pre-sampling approach instead.
- Equality `θe == θn` is effectively measure-zero with continuous RNGs and is
  not handled specially.
- All work is in-place friendly and uses `@inbounds`/`@views` in hot loops.
