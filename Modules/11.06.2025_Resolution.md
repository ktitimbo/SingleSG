### Resolution Target Measurement

- Vernier caliper precision: 0.0001 inch.
- Measured width of one black bar: $(0.0581\pm0.0002)/5$ inch. Here the 0.0002 inch is the bound, but in the analysis I treat it as $1\sigma$ just to have a safer result. The measured width is of the full group on the target (3 dark bars and 2 light bars of equal width).

### Camera Sensor

- Pixel size is 6.5 microns.

### Analysis Procedure

1. Choose the ROI on the measured image that contains the black bar of interest.
2. Check rotation. The image in the ROI is rotated by a list of angles and a score is calculated for each rotation. The rotation with best score is applied.
3. Fit a Gaussian blurred rectangle to the ROI image after integration along one dimension.
4. With distributions of object size and image size, we can sample them and do a Monte Carlo to find the distribution of magnification.

### Results

1. Camera lens magnification: $0.9996\pm0.0047$ ($1\sigma$). This replaces the previous value 1.05.
2. Single lens magnification: $1.1419\pm0.0050$. This replaces the previous value 1.1741.
3. Earlier single lens magnification: $1.1198\pm0.0061$. This replaces the previous value 1.2697.
